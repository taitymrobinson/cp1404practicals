## About me

In 2024, I am a first year uni student enrolled
in [JCU's Bachelor of IT](https://www.jcu.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-information-technology).
I am unsure about what field of IT specifically I would like to pursue career-wise, however I know that this is the
industry for me.

## Lessons Learnt

### 'Clean Code'

- Simplicity is better than complex. ([PEP20](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/))
- Even if a method works, if it is not the best tool for the job it shouldn't be used.
- Names should be able to distinguish what kind of data it is referring to.
