# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Based on my week 2 reflection I have improved the time I take reading instructions and paying attention to details
within the course. I have also increased the frequency in what I test in programs.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to change the way I approach planning for tasks, as well as the time I take into learning outside of the
bare-minimum requirements.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am continuing to be an active participant in all aspects of the class, which has allowed me a greater learning 
experience, compared to in previous classes where I was not an active participant.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop relying on 'last-minute' urgency to complete assignment tasks as it will allow me to create better
submissions and overall improve my learning journey.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would like to see an increase of the 'quiz' aspects within lecture videos, and an increase in example exam 
questions we are given to work through. These both improve my personal accountability.
